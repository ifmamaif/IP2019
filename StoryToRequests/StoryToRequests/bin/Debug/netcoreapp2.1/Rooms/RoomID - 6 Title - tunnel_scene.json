\'Greetings stranger, world travels fast around this city. I hear you\'ve been looking for me. I admire your dedication, not many strangers make it this far. Have you come to buy some merchandise, or
are you interested in my little business here. If you want the merch, all you need to do is give me half your posessions and grant me a small wish. Otherwise, we can go further down the tunnel, have 
some coffee, and I can tell you all about the order. I hope you're not thinking about something stupid, like calling a guard\'\n",
