\'Stranger! Stranger! Come closer!\'\n
As you approach the slave, you notice she looks somewhat different from the others.\n
\'Word around the city is that you're looking for something... I could help you... but is it really want you want? We can flee... right now... \'\n
You consider the slave's words. There is clearly something off about this city, and rescuing her might not be a bad way to escape this place. Of course, you could take her up on her offer
and find one of those stones you were looking for. She seems eager to tell you about the tunnel the Order uses for smuggling in the stones. Kitty seems a bit desperate, maybe you could convince her
to go with you to a different district and make a different sort of \'deal\'.\n",
